# Blanks
Prototype simple cryptogram iOS game

# Build
The project uses cocoapods so be sure to run pod install. You should also use the workspace and not the project file for editing in Xcode.

# Overview
This game is a simple prototype that shows a user a handful of words with letters missing. The user can fill in those missing letters using a custom keyboard-like view.

The game doesn't support much in terms of game state logic (points, new words, game over, etc). It was intended just to see how the basic operation of the game would work. At this time it doesn't seem like it'd make a particularly compelling game, so it's been shelved.
