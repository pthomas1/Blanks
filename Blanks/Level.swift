// The user is presented with a single word and a timer. The word is missing letters and the user has to
// select letters to add them back in. The player is presented with a new word and time is added to the clock
// whenever they complete a word. The new word is searched for using the missing letters from the previous
// word and must be unique within the level. Words become increasingly difficult over time.
//
// If your timer runs out on a word you drop down a word and get the time for that word added back on.
// The word you drop to is replaced by a new word with a similar difficulty level (but obviously different
// letters).
//
// The player loses when the timer reaches 0 and there is only one word on the screen.
//
// The player can ask for help during the level. When he does he can do one of a few things - select
// an unknown letter, populate a wildcard letter, remove letter(s) from the keyboard, add more time/pause time.
// At various points in a level the player can earn these back.
//
// The player can skip a word but pays a large time penalty - larger than a "normal" amount of time
// to figure it out. Maybe 2x the awarded time for that word for example.
//
// Game tracks the high water mark to offer bounses for exceeding it, runs, etc
//
